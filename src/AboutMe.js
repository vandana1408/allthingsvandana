                Hi! I'm Vandana. I'm early into my career in technology and am using this space to document my journey as it goes. I chose to make a react app for this purpose because I also want to develop my frontend skills a bit more and use this site to talk about all things âœ¨ Me âœ¨. 
                <br /> 
                <br />
                I studied a Bachelor of Bioinformatics Engineering at UNSW, where I took some coding subjects and gained a interest into engineering and technology. Aside from academics, I involved myself in a few societies to find others studying my degree and connect with those that I shared similar interests with.
                Currently, I'm completing a graduate program at a prominent Australian Bank in their engineering stream, where I hope to roll off as a software engineer.<br/>
                <br /> When I'm not hunched over a computer, I like to knit and crochet (I'm clearly quite active). A passive hobby from my childhood turned into an interest developed as quick as my interest in software engineering had over the COVID lockdowns and now I make clothes to express my creative side. 
                <br /> <br /> By pressing on the boxes above, you'll be take to more information in that particular area. Some areas haven't been filled in yet so that's why this just looks like a static website for now ðŸ˜….
