                Woohooo! Got the react app deployed :)

                Hi! I'm Vandana. I'm early into my career in technology and am using this space to document my journey as it goes. I chose to make a react app for this purpose because I also want to develop my frontend skills a bit more and use this site to talk about all things âœ¨ Me âœ¨. 
                <br /> 
                <br />
                I studied a Bachelor of Bioinformatics Engineering in my undergrad (think biology had a child with computer/data science). Aside from academics I involved myself in the UNSW Bioinformatics Society to learn more about the area and forge connections with others studying my degree.
                Currently, I'm completing a graduate program, with my first rotation in the HR Technology function, that supports 48 900 employees. I help build and maintain the platforms used by the HR Team, primarily focused on applications in Workday. <br/>
                <br /> My main hobbies include knitting/crocheting and reading, simply because every new garment made or book read has the same levels of satisfaction as deploying a new release to PROD. I got into knitting and crocheting heavily during the first COVID lockdown and enjoy reading for the stories.  
                <br /> <br /> Eventually the boxes below will take you to more information about myself in that category but for now this will just look like a static website ðŸ˜….
