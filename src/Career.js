            This timeline of my career was made using the Material UI framework with a couple customisations here and there to fit the colour scheme of this site. It's a work in progress, but that's the whole point of this website! 
            I hope to also include more detail into my experiences but if I'm lucky and work hard, this page will always be an unfinished novel ðŸ˜Š.
