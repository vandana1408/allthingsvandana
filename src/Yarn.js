                    I feel hopeful that before I turn 25 I'll be able to finish these projects and put more energy into some other hobbies to make me a well rounded individual.`

            Much like the satisfaction of deploying an important feature you've been working on for weeks, the same levels of dopamine are release when I weave in that last end of a knitted or crocheted project I've worked on for weeks. 
            I've used more math than I'd like to admit to create some of the things I've made over the last few years and more recently, have tried to find many overlaps to find a balance in integrating interests of mine with what I do every day.
